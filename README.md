# html5-typescript-canvas

This repository demonstrates low-level pixel operations on an HTML5 canvas using TypeScript. The focus is on a "C"-style programming approach, prioritizing minimalism and direct control without relying on third party libraries or language extensions.

## Key Features
- **Low-level pixel operations**: direct manipulation of the canvas at the pixel level
- **TypeScript implementation**: strong typing and modern JavaScript features for maintainable code
- **Minimal dependencies**: no heavy frameworks or libraries â€” just lean and mean, straightforward programming
